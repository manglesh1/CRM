// Recovered from the old aeroSportsAdmin/services/engage/templates/_systemCatalog.js
// (commit 3736134). 32 email templates total, plus families for grouping.

// Placeholder convention from the legacy catalog uses [Venue.Name] etc.
// We preserve those bracket-style tokens inside the body HTML AND a converted
// {{venueName}} version on the same line, so this works whether the binding's
// variableMap re-maps them or the caller already sends the camelCase names.
